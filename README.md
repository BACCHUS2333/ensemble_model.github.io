# Ensemble Model Repository
### Edited by Richard
### Date: Leap Day of 2024
This repository contains code for an ensemble model built using various machine learning techniques. The model is designed to address classification tasks, particularly focusing on binary classification scenarios. In this README, you'll find an overview of the code structure, functionality, and key components of the ensemble model.

## Overview

The ensemble model implemented in this repository combines multiple base learners to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. The repository includes scripts for data importation, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and ensemble construction. The primary goal is to provide a flexible framework for experimenting with different ensemble strategies and evaluating their performance on real-world datasets.

## Code Structure

The repository consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**: Initial steps involve importing the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis, and cleaning/preprocessing the data for modeling purposes.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy. This step includes techniques like decision trees, bagging, boosting, and superlearners.

3. **Ensemble Construction**: The ensemble model is built by combining predictions from multiple base learners using techniques like bagging and boosting. The final ensemble aims to improve predictive performance and generalization ability.

## Usage

To use the ensemble model implemented in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
